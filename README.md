Rework of "User Authentication with Django"
==============

Attempt to replicate Randall Degges' [User Authentication with Django](http://www.rdegges.com/user-authentication-with-django/) from 2010-02-17 using Django 1.6.2 and Python 2.6.6.

Much has changed in Django since the original article.  How can I get this simple example to work now?
